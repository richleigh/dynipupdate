# CloudFlare API Configuration

# CloudFlare Zone ID
# Find this in your domain's overview page on CloudFlare dashboard
CF_ZONE_ID=your_zone_id_here

# DNS Record Names
# Specify the EXACT full domain names you want created
# All domains are optional - configure only what you need

# Specific purpose domains (explicit full domain names)
INTERNAL_DOMAIN=anubis.i.4.bees.wtf   # Internal/private IPs only (RFC1918)
EXTERNAL_DOMAIN=anubis.e.4.bees.wtf   # External IPv4 only
IPV6_DOMAIN=anubis.6.bees.wtf         # External IPv6 only
TAILSCALE_DOMAIN=anubis.ts.bees.wtf   # Tailscale/VPN IPs (100.x.x.x)

# Combined domain - THE MAIN FEATURE!
# This domain gets ALL IPs (internal + tailscale + external IPv4 + IPv6)
# Use this as your primary hostname - it works from anywhere:
#   - From internal network: resolves to internal IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)
#   - From Tailscale network: resolves to Tailscale IPs (100.x.x.x)
#   - From internet: resolves to external IPv4/IPv6
#   - DNS returns all records, your OS picks the best route
COMBINED_DOMAIN=anubis.bees.wtf

# Top-level CNAME alias (OPTIONAL)
# Creates a friendly CNAME pointing to COMBINED_DOMAIN
# Example: anubis.example.com -> anubis.bees.wtf
# Users can use the memorable name, DNS resolves through CNAME to get all IPs
TOP_LEVEL_DOMAIN=anubis.example.com

# Optional: Whether to proxy records through CloudFlare (default: false)
# Set to 'true' to enable CloudFlare proxy (orange cloud)
# Note: Typically set to false for dynamic DNS
CF_PROXIED=false

# Cleanup Configuration (only used when running with -cleanup flag)
# How old a heartbeat must be before records are considered stale
STALE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=3600   # 1 hour (default)

# How often to check for stale records
CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300   # 5 minutes (default)
